# Handling Recruitment Process

This tool in Atlas is designed to streamline and simplify the recruitment process for both Department Directors and applicants. With this feature, Department Directors can now upload a CSV file containing applicant details, automating the email communication and allowing applicants to monitor their interview status. Let's explore how this feature works step-by-step.

<Steps>
### Accessing the Recruitment Dashboard

Log in to the NUS Fintech Society HRMS using your Department Director credentials.

From the main dashboard, click on the "Recruitment" tab on the top navigation menu.

### Uploading Applicant Details

On the Recruitment Dashboard, click on the "Create Applicants" button.

Prepare a CSV file with all the applicant details, following the specified header format strictly.

| Heading                   | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Name                 | The full name of the applicant                                         |
| NUS email (xxx@u.nus.edu) | The NUS email of the new applicant                                   |
| Gmail                     | The gmail of the new applicant                                           |
| Student ID (AXXXXXXXX)    | The student ID of the new applicant                                             |
| First Choice Role         | The role the applicant wants the most                            |
| First Choice Department   | The department of the role indicated in the first choice                |
| Second Choice Role        | The role the applicant wants next               |
| Second Choice Department  | The department of the role indicated in the second choice |
| Resume                    | A google drive link to the resume of the applicant                     |

Proceed to upload the file and submit.

### Automated Email Notifications

Once the CSV file is uploaded, Atlas will automatically send email notifications to all applicants.

The notification will acknowledge receipt of their application and inform them about the recruitment process. It will also create an applicant account for them which they can use to track the status of their application.

### Update Interview Status
Department directors can use the interview notes feature on each applicant's card to add additional notes about applicants. They can also update the status of the application by clicking on the coloured circle. When an applicant is offered the role, an email will be sent to the applicant to ask them to accept the offer on Atlas.

### Offer Acceptance and Account Conversion
Once the member accepts the offer, they will be asked to update their details on Atlas. Their account will then be converted to a member's account with the updated details.

As new members, Atlas will send them an email containing important information and a warm welcome note.
