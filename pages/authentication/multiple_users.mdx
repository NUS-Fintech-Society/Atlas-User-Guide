### Upload and submit CSV file

Upload the CSV file onto HRMS. The accounts will automatically be created and the default password will be sent to members' Gmail accounts.

### Remind members to login and change their password

After account creation, make sure that all members login and change their password. This is also a good time to check that all members have received their accounts.
